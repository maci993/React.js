        After working for 7 plus years in the field of Education as a teacher, I
        realized that this field wasn't for me. I wanted to get into something
        exciting and more challenging. IT was always there on my mind, but I did
        not have any computer background. But I made the choice, I joined the
        program, and I am halfway to get my certificate like a full stack
        JavaScript Developer, and I feel really good for this choice I made.{" "}
